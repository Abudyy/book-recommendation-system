Project by Hamza Pathan and Abdullah Paracha

This project is a machine learning-based book recommendation system. The system uses various machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of books, ratings and users, and recommend books that are likely to be of interest to the user. (The dataset is from kaggle)

## Overview

The book recommendation system is designed to provide personalized book recommendations to users. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and  other recommendation algorithms to generate accurate and relevant book recommendations. It is a popularity-based recommendation system

## Features

- (POSSIBLY) User authentication and profile management 
- Recommendation engine
- Simple website to showcase a working recommendation system

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Flask OR react (for web application)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for front-end)

# Limitations and notes:

The website has very limited number of books, that's because, these books will give the BEST recommendations. Although the dataset consists of 242135 unique book titles, much of it got filtered out. 
And the amount of books left in the recommender system gives the best accuracy in predictions, we thought of increasing the #. of books, but this would decrease the accuracy.
